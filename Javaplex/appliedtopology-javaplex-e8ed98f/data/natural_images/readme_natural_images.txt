A natural image is a photograph. Consider natural images which contain a greyscale value at each pixel. In the paper "On the local behavior of spaces of natural images", authors Gunnar Carlsson, Tigran Ishkhanov, Vin de Silva, and Afra Zomorodian study several dense core subsets of a space of high-contrast 3x3 natural image patches. In particular, the authors find that their dense core subset X(300,30) has the topology of a circle and that their dense core subset X(15,30) has the topology of an interesting space containing three circles. A more complicated subset has the topology of a Klein bottle.

These dense core subsets are also discussed in the paper "Topological estimation using witness complexes" by Vin de Silva and Gunnar Carlsson, which is available at

The dataset of natural image patches is from "The nonlinear statistics of high-contrast patches in natural images" by Ann Lee, Kim Pdersen, and David Mumford, which is available at
http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/ijcv/ijcv54.html
The patches are taken from van Hateren's natural image database, which is available at

The Matlab file n50000Dct.mat is a collection of 50000 random points from the space M of patches in "On the local behavior of spaces of natural images".
The Matlab file nk300c30Dct.mat contains a version of the core subset X(300,30).
The Matlab file nk15c30Dct.mat contains a version of the core subset X(15,30).
