# JavaPlex

## Persistent Homology and Topological Data Analysis Library 


The `JavaPlex` library implements persistent homology and related techniques from computational and applied topology, in a library designed for ease of use, ease of access from Matlab and java-based systems, and ease of extensions for further research projects and approaches.

`JavaPlex` is mainly developed by the [Computational Topology workgroup](http://comptop.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, and is based on previous similar packages from the same group.

For persistent homology and its capabilities, we recommend the survey article [Topology and Data](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf) by Gunnar Carlsson.
