/**
 * A <code>Simplex</code> is the basic unit for simplicial homology
 * calculations, literally. That is, the module in which simplicial
 * homology is defined is the free module over all simplices, so a simplex
 * is actually a basis element for this module. Formally, simplices are
 * elements of a set S of non-empty finite subsets of a set X which have
 * the property that if B is an element of S, and A is a non-empty subset
 * of B, then A is an element of S. Intuitively, if you imagine that the
 * points of X are in some n-dimensional Euclidean space, then a simplex is
 * that subset of Euclidean space that is given by the affine combinations
 * of its "corners". For instance, if B is the triangle given by corners
 * {a, b, c} is one of our simplices, then we require that the edge (line
 * segment) given by {a, c} is also a simplex. While we can describe this
 * relationship in a purely combinatorial fashion, the "meaning" is given
 * by the choice of simplices S, and this methodology used here always
 * makes some use of geometric techniques (e.g., metric spaces).
 *
 * <p> For reasons of efficiency, we use more than one encoding for
 * simplices, instead of using the obvious "array of vertices". The reason
 * for this is that these encodings of simplices can be much smaller, and
 * the code to manage them much faster, than if we use the obvious
 * implementation. We make <code>Simplex</code> an abstract class, instead
 * of an interface, both because code written to this class will be
 * slightly faster than if it were an interface, and because the root class
 * is a convenient repository for some utilities needed by the extension
 * classes, and for "global information" such as the characteristic of the
 * base field.
 *
 * <p> All but the most naive encoding must have, either implicitly or
 * explicitly, limits on the allowed dimension and number of landmarks that
 * can be used to construct simplices. By default all limits will either be
 * the explicit in the representation of the simplex or will be implicitly
 * the largest values that are feasible for that representation. See the
 * specific implementations for more details on this point.
 *
 * <p> The vertex set of any simplex depends on the context -- that is, for
 * a Simplex s, s.vertices() is an array of integers of limited size, and
 * the meaning of those integers will depend on the source of the Simplex
 * s.  The data sets we operate on frequently have millions of points (and
 * we hope to push these even further in the future), but we only construct
 * simplices from much smaller sets, often representative subsets we call
 * "landmark sets". Since we are able to restrict landmarks to be in the
 * thousands, or even hundreds, we use a smaller number of bits to encode
 * the vertex sets for a simplex, often by "indirecting" through an array
 * of landmark indices to some much larger data set. Thus, a vertex of 10
 * encoded within an instance of <code>Simplex</code> generally refers to
 * the point whose index is the 10th entry in some landmark set, not the
 * 10th point in the full data set.
