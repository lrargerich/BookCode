	// This is a little tricky. We want a way to iterate over all of the
	// subsets of the vertex set, and return simplices for each of those
	// subsets. (These subsets are the lower dimensional faces of the
	// simplex.) If we consider the set with N elements to be {0,...,N-1},
	// then the k subsets of N are given by all possible {x0<...<x(k-1)}, so we
	// can enumerate this with a k vector where we iterate over all
	// possible such arrangements of values. It doesn't particularly matter
	// what order we use, so we generate the sets lexicographically since
	// this seems simplest to understand. Clearly the first subset in this
	// ordering will be [0,...,(k-1)], and for any subset S = [x0,....x(k-1)] where
	// x(k-1)<N, the next subset is [x0,...,x(k-1)+1]. In fact, for any S =
	// [x0,...,xj,..,x(k-1)], the next subset is [x0,...,x(j-1)] adjoined to
	// the next subset for [xj,...,x(k-1)]. Notice that we can consider
	// [xj,...,x(k-1)] just as a subset of {xj,...,N} (the xi are increasing).
	// Since the last entry in {xj,...,N} will be [(N-j)+1,...,N-1,N], all
	// we need to do to find the next entry after S is to find a j so that
	// [xj,...,x(k-1)] is not of that form. That is, we find the last subscript
	// j such that xj < N-(k-j). If there is no such index, then S =
	// [N-k,...,N-1] -- in other words, S is the last subset. If there is
	// such a j, then the next subset is [1+xj,2+xj,...] adjoined to
	// [x0,...,x(j-1)]. Therefore, if are any subsets, that is, if N>k>0,
	// we set an array we use as a "counter" to the initial value of
	// [0,...,k-2,k-2] (that is, the last entry is one less than it should
	// be), that when we ask for the first time for the "next" set, we get
	// the first set. 
	//
	// In practice our vertex sets are given as an array of indices
	// V[]=[v0,v1,...,v(N-1)], so the k-subsets are actually enumerated by
	// enumerating the indices -- that is we enumerate [x0,...,x(k-1)] in the
	// set [0,...N-1], and then the sets {V[x0],...,V[x(k-1)]} iterate over
	// all k-sets of V. This is the reason that the code here is using
	// 0-based counting.
