	// Implementation note: In the code below, L is the number of landmarks

	// papers a bit more, we have the indices go from 1 to L (or N),
	// instead of from 0 to L-1 (or N-1), which would be the normal way in
	// C (and hence C++ and Java). So the 0-th entry of things in nothing,
	// and when we make arrays that get indexed directly, they are 1
	// longer. When we index matrices we create a 1-array and then have an
	// indexing function that adjusts the arguments (that is, we can make
	// the 1-array exactly the right length). Since Java should inline
	// these indexing functions, and the compiler can't deal with 2-arrays

	// The algorithm here is a bit different than the the one for Rips
	// complexes, but it is still an iterative process in increasing
	// dimension of the simplices being constructed. A (non-lazy) Witness
	// complex contains a simplex s iff the complex contains each of the
	// faces of s, and there is a witness for s itself. The idea is to
	// start off adding the landmarks, and building the distance matrix, as
	// we do in LazyWitnessStream. However, after that we construct an
	// array m[][] of double[max_dimension] of the 1st, 2nd,
	// ... max_dimension-th smallest distances for each of the 1<=n<=N pts
	// in data.  Then, we construct the edge set just as for
	// LazyWitnessStream with nu=2. Now, at each step for dim = d, we have
	// the d-1 dimensional simplices, each with there filtration indices
	// set, stored in the queue. We then create an intering table for this
	// set of d-1 dimensional "faces", and iterate over the d-dimensional
	// simplices just as in RipsStream or LazyWitnessStream. However, the
	// first step in processing a d-dimensional simplex is to compute its
	// boundary, and confirm that each face is in the interning table. If
	// this succeeds we will return the maximum filtration index of all of
	// the faces. If it fails, we go onto the next d-dimensional simplex,
	// but if it succeeds, we must find the 1<=n<=N with the smallest
	// max(dist(i, p1), ... dist(i, pd)). We take this value, subtract from
	// it the entry in m[k-1][i] (the k-th smallest distance, indexed from
	// 0 to max_dimension-1). If this difference Rs is <= R_max, we accept
	// the simplex, and the filtration index is the maximum of the maximum
	// of the faces and floor(max(Rs, 0.0)/delta).  Note that this
	// iteration is more expensive both because it is necessary to
	// construct m[][], but also because the last step of acceptance
	// requires O(k*N) operations. I see no way of avoiding this.
